I gave this talk about a month ago. I managed to do 20 slides and 20 lyrics in 5 minutes. I was shooting for 40 slides and 40 song lyrics in 10 minutes, which was a bit extreme. BUT I DID IT -- 43 EACH. So I'll be moving quickly. “this time, I’m telling you…”

Also, side note that unless you are like me and love T-Swift AND checksums, you'll probably be at least 50% confused during this whole thing. But it'll be fun.

Security-wise, checksums are used to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack by using this Taylor Swift method of breakup success. I made a diagram! To represent this better. So, you can see here... encrypted passwords or other sensitive information can pass through a network to another location without that information being compromised. “You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me”  Cuz we certainly aren't talking, right? WE BROKE UP!

The way this is successful is if information is passed through other channels but never directly, it doesn't matter if hackers are "standing by you, waiting at your back door," your data will still be safe because plaintext information is never transferred directly, and that obfuscation and abstraction happens just like this. Except instead of your friends and my friends, its checksums and salting.

            <aside class="notes">
I mentioned Salting. Salt is a random string, which is linked to existing password hashes and then hashed again for extra layers of protection. Like friends protecting you from bad exes. The salt value and resulting hash is then stored in the database. You are able to encrypt that information, without each other, it cannot be un-encrypted. So you can "shake it off."

            <aside class="notes">
A collision attack attempts to find two arbitrary outputs which produce the same hash value -- hence, a collision. "A simple complication, miscommunication leads to fallout..." (Two files existing with the same value). There's a vulnerability here, if someone can fake your checksum, they can get to the information they want. Like if Drew looks at you and you "fake a smile so he won't see." Or maybe moreso, someone can inject bad information into your files...

Security-wise, these things don't last "forever & always." So you hear, oh, “_this format_ is broken.” MD5, SHA-1. What does that mean? It's because the technology that keeps these file fingerprints secure can be corrupted if the algorithm can be decrypted by computers. “This slope is treacherous, this path is dangerous”

1. It's the ability to break the code at all, and 2. as well as the amount of time and money necessary to cause that break to happen. If an algorithm would take modern computers years to decrypt, it's still pretty secure. It's "my Achilles heel." It follows a sort of Moore's Law pattern: it gets faster and cheaper every day. Info security is a moving target. "These walls that they put up will fall down."

CRC! This stands for Cycle Redundancy Check. "We were both young when I first saw you." The CRC was invented by W. Wesley Peterson way back in 1961; CRC32 is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975. “32, and still growing up now.” It's a lot older and more basic of a process, so obviously there are lots of limitations here... not good for security, can be faked easily. But it is used in file format verification, Matroska files being an example of this, using a self-check mechanism.

SHA is very common, but it gets a little complicated because there are different numbers meaning different things. "It's a rollercoaster kind of rush."

The lower, less secure versions (SHA-1) are used to generate small unique identifiers, like git commits. Git uses SHA-1 so you have unique commits.

HTTPS used to use SHA-1, but that's been broken for a while. "All this time, how could you not know, baby?"

MD5 stands for Message Digest algorithm 5 (y'know, because computer scientists are great at naming things) and was invented by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace the old MD4 standard (you can guess what MD4 stood for). It's broken, though. Sorry. Busted.
